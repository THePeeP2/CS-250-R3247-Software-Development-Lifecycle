**Overview:**
This folder has stuff from my Computer Science program, like things I did for different classes. For this assignment, I put in the Sprint Review and Retrospective from my Final Project. It shows how I used agile and Scrum during the course.

**What's Inside:**
The Sprint Review and Retrospective is all about how I worked on my Final Project. It talks about how I improved my project step by step and what I learned along the way.

**Big Questions I Answered:**
I also talked about some important questions:

1. **Understanding User Needs:**
   I explained how I listened to what users wanted and made sure to include those things in my project. User stories helped me understand what users needed most.

2. **How I Work on Projects:**
   I shared my approach to working on projects, like breaking them into small parts and testing as I go. I want to keep using these methods in the future.

3. **Being a Good Team Player:**
   I talked about how important it is to be a good teammate when working on software projects. It means communicating well, being open to feedback, and helping each other succeed.

**Wrap-up:**
This folder shows what I've been up to in my Computer Science program and how I've been learning to work on projects using agile methods. It's a record of my progress and shows I can use these skills in real projects.
